\chapter{Remaining Useful Life Prediction}
\label{chap: rul}

In this chapter, we propose a framework for predicting RUL of EoL products based on the ultrasonic testing. The framework has two parts: \begin{enumerate*}[label=\itshape\alph*\upshape)]
    \item a ML classification task and
    \item a RUL inference procedure based on S-N curve.
\end{enumerate*}  First, ultrasonic signals are fed into ML classifiers to predict the loading condition and the number of fatigue cycles that a sample has gone through. Second, we estimate RUL from a S-N curve with the predicted loading condition and fatigue cycles.

\section{Problem formulation}
Given the goal of predicting RUL on EoL products, we need to formulate this as a ML problem first. In this section, We discuss possible formulations by considering the characteristics of the fatigue dataset and the impact on the ML system in practice.

\subsection{Dataset}
In this RUL prediction task, the dataset is constructed on the ultrasonic measurements on the interrupted fatigue testing specimens in Table \ref{table: interrupted specimens}. There are 15 specimens and each of these were measured at 9 locations alongside 3 repeated measurements, producing 405 observations in total. Notice that we treat one measurement location in one specimen as a sample in the model training and validation with LOGOCV, as described in Section \ref{sec: model train and val}.
