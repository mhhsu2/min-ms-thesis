\chapter{Experimental Dataset}
Data is the core in data-driven or machine learning based applications. This chapter describes the dataset and the experimental procedure used in this research. First, the cyclic fatigue testing was conducted till the rupture of a material to acquire the fatigue characteristics of a material such as S-N curve. Second, to mimic the scenarios in the remanufacturing industry, interrupted fatigue testing was utilized to produce specimens at different fatigue levels as simulated end-of-life products. Linear and nonlinear ultrasound measurements are used to evaluate the fatigue damage of those specimens stopped at the predetermined number of cycles in the interrupted fatigue testing. Besides, the residual stress and full-width-at-half-maximum data from X-ray diffraction are also presented.

\section{Life cycle fatigue testing}
The life cycle fatigue testing aims to collect the fatigue life data to comprehensively understand the fatigue behavior of our targeted material. The fatigue life of a material is defined as the total number of cycles that a material can sustain under a specified loading condition. In order to develope the S-N curve of a material, the material is tested at different loading stress amplitudes, and the fatigue test is repeated multiple times for each loading stress amplitude to account for the variance of fatigue life.

% The fatigue testing in this research is led by Prof. Jingjing Li's group at the Penn State University. 
The targeted material in this research is 5052-H32 aluminum alloy which are widely used for car body construction in the automotive industry. Figure \ref{fig: fatigue testing setup} shows the dimension of the specimen and the fatigue testing machine. Three loading amplitudes, 11.7, 12.7, and 14.7 kN for the cyclic fatigue testing are selected to develop the S-N curve which is shown in Figure \ref{fig: raw sn curve}.

\section{Interrupted fatigue testing}
The purpose of performing interrupted fatigue testing is to produce specimens at various fatigue levels by stopping the cyclic fatigue testing at several predetermined number of cycles. Considering the cost of the fatigue testing, the number of cycles where the fatigue testing stopped is at two levels, around 33\% and 67\% fatigue life corresponding to the three loading amplitudes, 11.7, 12.7, and 14.7 kN. These specimens are used to represent the end-of-life products having different fatigue damage levels in the remanufacturing industry. Besides, three specimens without going through fatigue testing, i.e., 0\% fatigue life, are included as specimens at the healthy state. The summary of the interrupted fatigue testing specimens is presented in Table \ref{table: interrupted specimens}
