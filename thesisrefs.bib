Fatigue phenomena occur when a material is subjected to fluctuating stresses and strains, which lead to failure due to damage accumulation. Different methods, including the Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule- (LDR-) based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, energy-based, and continuum damage mechanics methods, forecast fatigue life. This paper reviews fatigue life prediction techniques for metallic materials. An ideal fatigue life prediction model should include the main features of those already established methods, and its implementation in simulation systems could help engineers and scientists in different applications. In conclusion, LDR-based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, continuum damage mechanics, and energy-based methods are easy, realistic, microstructure dependent, well timed, and damage connected, respectively, for the ideal prediction model.},

It plays, therefore, an important role in the prevention of failure. QNDE techniques are used in processing, manufacturing and for in-service inspection. QNDE is particularly important for the in-service inspection of high-cost and critical load-bearing structures whose failure could have tragic consequences. In this paper, we briefly review the most important techniques, and then we focus the discussion on quantitative ultrasonics, particularly for crack detection and for the determination of elastic constants. The important role of measurement models is emphasized. New techniques in quantitative ultrasonics are discussed, including laser-based ultrasonics and acoustic microscopy. The possible applications of neural networks are indicated. Attention is also devoted to the probability of detection concept and its relation to probabilistic fatigue methods and fatigue reliability.}

  abstract = {Abstract Efforts to understand fatigue in materials generally rely on defining relationships between the material response to fatigue loading and the evolving remaining material life portion. Typical measurements and data associated with such relationships include load (stress), displacement (strain), and associated properties (eg, mean stress and strain, energy dissipation, and residual stiffness). In addition to obtaining such measurements, efforts have been made to leverage nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to obtain additional information and enhance the description of the material fatigue response, especially its evolution due to interacting material-microstructure-property relationships. Given the range of available NDE methods and the number of materials they can be applied to, a critical overview of related investigations is presented in this article. Specifically, the state of the art of applying optical, thermal, acoustic, electromagnetic, X-ray, and other diffraction NDE methods in fatigue investigations is provided and discussed. The methods are individually described for background and defining their relationship to fatigue, followed by descriptions of their current uses and contributions to enhancing the understanding of fatigue, and their limitations and ways that improvements could be made.},

Ultrasonic pulses were generated by an x-cut quartz transducer firmly attached to the clamped end of a specimen rod using Eastman 910 cement. The frequencies of these ultrasonic pulses were 10 MHz for polycrystalline aluminum and 5 MHz for cold rolled steel. The specimen shape, transducer size, and frequency used insured that the entire specimen was completely filled with ultrasound in a guided wave mode. The specimen was fatigued as a cantilever beam in reverse bending at 1800 cycles per minute with vertical amplitude peak-to-peak set at a fixed value in the range 7·5–15 mm. In a typical test the ultrasonic attenuation initially remained constant, increased slowly, and then increased catastropically just prior to fracture of the test specimen. All experiments performed on both aluminum and steel specimens at various vibrational amplitudes yielded similar results in that ultrasonic attenuation served as a very sensitive indicator of fatigue damage and in every case indicated that failure was eminent several hours before conventional ultrasonic testing could detect an additional echo caused by energy reflected from a crack. These results strongly suggest that ultrasonic attenuation measurements can be exploited successfully to predict earlier fatigue damage and perhaps fatigue life in practical applications.}

Our results show that appropriate feature design combined with simple k-nearest neighbor classifier can provide up to 98% classification accuracy even though conventional features for time-series data and a variety of classifiers cannot achieve close to 70% accuracy. The newly proposed hybrid feature, which combines frequency domain information in the form of power spectral density and time domain information in the form of sign of slope change, is a suitable feature for achieving the best classification accuracy on this challenging problem.},

Wavelet transform is used to derive a feature vector which contains two-dimensional information on various types of defects. These vectors are then classified using an ANN trained with the back propagation algorithm. The inputs of the ANN are the features extracted from each ultrasonic oscillogram. Four different types of defect are considered namely porosity, lack of fusion, and tungsten inclusion and non defect. The training of the ANN uses supervised learning mechanism and therefore each input has the respective desired output. The available dataset is randomly split into a training subset (to update the weight values) and a validation subset. With the wavelet features and ANN, good classification at the rate of 94{\%} is obtained.

The particular acoustoelastic technique considered here employs longitudinal waves propagating normal to the plane of the stress. Such waves experience a shift in propagation speed which, for an isotropic material, is proportional to the sum of the principal stresses. A Poisson’s equation for the in-plane shear stress is obtained from the two-dimensional equilibrium equations in which the forcing function is obtained directly from the measured velocity variations. Once this equation is integrated for the shear stress, the normal stresses may be evaluated directly from the equilibrium equations. In this paper, the basic equations are derived for the case of an anisotropic material. The experimental and numerical procedures are reviewed, and results of residual stresses in an aluminum ring are presented.}},

The effects of a slightly orthotropic symmetry on wave velocities are investigated in the case of the aluminium alloy plate, which exhibits a texture due to rolling processes. Special calibration, performed on two test specimens, allows the effect of this texture to be taken into account.

  abstract = {Generally, material stress measurement using ultrasonic longitudinal critically refracted (LCR) wave is inevitably influenced by ambient temperature and coupling condition, which limits its industrial application. In this article, the sensitivity of stress measurement accuracy to temperature variation and coupling condition is discussed analytically and numerically. Based on this, the ultrasonic signal-detecting mode is improved by one-transmitter-two-receiver signal-detecting configuration. Meanwhile, a novel coupling condition is also created by directly filling with couplant between the ultrasonic probe and the measured surface. The testing results showed that the temperature sensitivity could be reduced to 0.81 ns/°C compared with −16.82 ns/°C of the traditional one-transmitter-one-receiver signal detecting configuration, and less distortion and attenuation of the detecting LCR wave signals could also be obtained. Further, a pre-stretched aluminum alloy with uniaxial stress was employed to verify the feasibility of the developed method and probe. The stress measurement accuracy could achieve 20 MPa compared with the simulation results.}

  abstract = {The planned life extension of nuclear reactors throughout the US and abroad will cause reactor vessel and internals materials to be exposed to more neutron irradiation than was originally intended. A nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method to monitor radiation damage would enable safe and cost-effective continued operation of nuclear reactors. Radiation damage in reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels causes microstructural changes that leave the material in an embrittled state. Nonlinear ultrasound is an NDE technique quantified by the measurable acoustic nonlinearity parameter, which is sensitive to microstructural changes in metallic materials such as dislocations, precipitates and their combinations. Recent research has demonstrated the sensitivity of the acoustic nonlinearity parameter to increasing neutron fluence in representative RPV steels. The current work considers nonlinear ultrasonic experiments conducted on similar RPV steel samples that had a combination of irradiation, annealing, re-irradiation, and/or re-annealing to a total neutron fluence of 0.5–5×1019n/cm2 (E>1MeV) at an irradiation temperature of 290°C. The acoustic nonlinearity parameter generally increased with increasing neutron fluence, and consistently decreased from the irradiated to the annealed state over different levels of neutron fluence. Results of the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter are compared with those from previous measurements on other RPV steel samples. This comprehensive set of results illustrates the dependence of the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter on neutron fluence, material composition, irradiation temperature and annealing.}

  abstract = {The ultimate strength of most structural materials is mainly limited by the presence of microscopic imperfections serving as nuclei of the fracture process. Since these nuclei are considerably shorter than the acoustic wavelength at the frequencies normally used in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE), linear acoustic characteristics are not sufficiently sensitive to this kind of microscopic degradation of the material's integrity. On the other hand, even very small imperfections can produce very significant excess nonlinearity which can be orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic nonlinearity of the intact material. The excess nonlinearity is produced mainly by the strong local nonlinearity of microcracks whose opening is smaller than the particle displacement. Parametric modulation via crack-closure significantly increases the stress-dependence of fatigued materials. A special experimental technique was introduced to measure the second-order acousto-elastic coefficient in a great variety of materials including plastics, metals, composites and adhesives. Experimental results are presented to illustrate that the nonlinear acoustic parameters are earlier and more sensitive indicators of fatigue damage than their linear counterparts.}

  abstract = {Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of critical assets is an important challenge in condition based maintenance to improve reliability and decrease machine’s breakdown and maintenance’s cost. Bearing is one of the most important components in industries which need to be monitored and the user should predict its RUL. The challenge of this study is to propose an original feature able to evaluate the health state of bearings and to estimate their RUL by Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) techniques. In this paper, the proposed method is based on the data-driven prognostic approach. The combination of Simplified Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory Map (SFAM) neural network and Weibull distribution (WD) is explored. WD is used just in the training phase to fit measurement and to avoid areas of fluctuation in the time domain. SFAM training process is based on fitted measurements at present and previous inspection time points as input. However, the SFAM testing process is based on real measurements at present and previous inspections. Thanks to the fuzzy learning process, SFAM has an important ability and a good performance to learn nonlinear time series. As output, seven classes are defined; healthy bearing and six states for bearing degradation. In order to find the optimal RUL prediction, a smoothing phase is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reliably predict the RUL of rolling element bearings (REBs) based on vibration signals. The proposed prediction approach can be applied to prognostic other various mechanical assets.}

Model-based prognostic methods develop closed-form mathematical models based on underlying physics. However, the physics of complex bearing failures under varying operating conditions is not well understood yet. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings. As opposed to other machine learning methods, ensemble learning methods can achieve higher prediction accuracy by combining multiple learning algorithms of different types. The rationale behind ensemble learning is that higher performance can be achieved by combining base learners that overestimate and underestimate the RUL of bearings. However, building an effective ensemble remains a challenge. To address this issue, the impact of diversity in base learners and extracted features in different degradation stages on the performance of ensemble learning is investigated. The degradation process of bearings is classified into three stages, including normal wear, smooth wear, and severe wear, based on the root-mean-square (RMS) of vibration signals. To evaluate the impact of diversity on prediction performance, vibration data collected from rolling element bearings was used to train predictive models. Experimental results have shown that the performance of the proposed ensemble learning method is significantly improved by selecting diverse features and base learners in different degradation stages.}},

However, recent data-driven approaches for bearing RUL prediction still require prior knowledge to extract features, construct health indicate (HI) and set up threshold, which is inefficient in the big data era. In this paper, a pure data-driven method for bearing RUL prediction with little prior knowledge is proposed. This method includes three steps, i.e., features extraction, HI prediction and RUL calculation. In the first step, five band-pass energy values of frequency spectrum are extracted as features. Then, a recurrent neural network based on encoder–decoder framework with attention mechanism is proposed to predict HI values, which are designed closely related with the RUL values in this paper. Finally, the final RUL value can be obtained via linear regression. Experiments carried out on the dataset from PRONOSTIA and comparison with other novel approaches demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better performance.}

Traditionally, degradation process is represented in the form of physical or expert models. Such models require extensive experimentation and verification that are not always feasible. Another approach that builds up knowledge about the system degradation over the time from component sensor data is known as data driven. Data driven models, however, require that sufficient historical data have been collected. In this paper, a two phases data driven method for RUL prediction is presented. In the offline phase, the proposed method builds on finding variables that contain information about the degradation behavior using unsupervised variable selection method. Different health indicators (HIs) are constructed from the selected variables, which represent the degradation as a function of time, and saved in the offline database as reference models. In the online phase, the method finds the most similar offline HI, to the online HI, using k-nearest neighbors classifier to use it as a RUL predictor. The method finally estimates the degradation state using discrete Bayesian filter. The method is verified using battery and turbofan engine degradation simulation data acquired from NASA data repository. The results show the effectiveness of the method in predicting the RUL for both applications.},

The proposed methodology combines Bayesian inference, piezoelectric sensor measurements, and a mechanical stiffness degradation model for in-situ fatigue life prediction. First, the composites stiffness degradation is introduced to account for the composites fatigue damage accumulation under cyclic loadings and a new growth rate-based stiffness degradation model is developed. Following this, the general Bayesian updating-based fatigue life prediction method is discussed. Several sources of uncertainties and the developed stiffness degradation model are included in the prognosis framework. Next, an in-situ composites fatigue testing with piezoelectric sensors is designed and performed to collected sensor signal and the global stiffness data. Signal processing techniques are implemented to extract damage diagnosis features. The detected stiffness degradation is integrated in the Bayesian inference framework for the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Prognosis performance on experimental data is validated using prognostics metric. Finally, some conclusions and future work are drawn based on the proposed study.}

  abstract = { A general framework for probabilistic prognosis and uncertainty management under fatigue cyclic loading is proposed in this article. First, the general idea using the Bayesian updating in prognosis is introduced. Several sources of uncertainties are discussed and included in the Bayesian updating framework. An equivalent stress level model is discussed for the mechanism-based fatigue crack growth analysis, which serves as the deterministic model for the lap joint fatigue life prognosis. Next, an in situ lap joint fatigue test with pre-installed piezoelectric sensors is designed and performed to collect experimental data. Signal processing techniques are used to extract damage features for crack length estimation. Following this, the proposed methodology is demonstrated using the experimental data under both constant and variable amplitude loadings. Finally, detailed discussion on validation metrics of the proposed prognosis algorithm is given. Several conclusions and future work are drawn based on the proposed study. }

  abstract  = {With increasing use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in several industries such as aviation, automotive and construction, effective reliability analysis of composites has become imperative in recent years. Periodic inspection by robust non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques and accurate health prognosis is essential for condition-based maintenance (CBM) of the safety-critical components and structures. Prediction of future damage level in composites often becomes challenging due to lack of physics-based damage growth models for unknown materials which leaves us to rely solely on the NDE data for prognosis. In this study, delamination growth in glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) joints, under Mode I cyclic loading, was monitored by guided waves(GW) using miniature surface-mounted piezoelectric wafers(PZT). Data-driven prognosis techniques such as Kalman filter and particle filter were implemented on the indirect CBM data obtained from GW signals to predict future delamination area and validated against optical transmission scans (OTS) of damaged samples. A comparison of data-driven prognosis methods with static regression versus dynamic update of estimated parameters is presented in this paper. Results show that even when a simple logarithmic fit is assumed, use of NDE data to estimate function parameters in a stochastic framework outperforms the static regression approach leading to a robust sensor-aided reliability analysis.},

  abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) is the useful life left on an asset at a particular time of operation. Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not. We systematically review the models and approaches reported in the literature and finally highlight future research challenges.}

  abstract = {Given the advancements in modern technological capabilities, having an integrated health management and diagnostic strategy becomes an important part of a system’s operational life-cycle. This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated.}

A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively. To fill this gap, this paper provides a review on machinery prognostics following its whole program, i.e., from data acquisition to RUL prediction. First, in data acquisition, several prognostic datasets widely used in academic literature are introduced systematically. Then, commonly used HI construction approaches and metrics are discussed. After that, the HS division process is summarized by introducing its major tasks and existing approaches. Afterwards, the advancements of RUL prediction are reviewed including the popular approaches and metrics. Finally, the paper provides discussions on current situation, upcoming challenges as well as possible future trends for researchers in this field.}

  abstract = {A wide variety of Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) techniques deal with the problem of predicting the time for an asset fault. Most statistical approaches rely on historical failure data that might not be available in several practical situations. To address this issue, practitioners might require the use of self-starting approaches that consider only the available knowledge about the current degradation process and the asset operating context to update the prognostic model. Some authors use Autoregressive (AR) models for this purpose that are adequate when the asset operating context is constant, however, if it is variable, the accuracy of the models can be affected. In this paper, three autoregressive models with exogenous variables (ARX) were constructed, and their capability to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a process was evaluated following the case of the aluminum crack growth problem. An existing stochastic model of aluminum crack growth was implemented and used to assess RUL estimation performance of the proposed ARX models through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Point and interval estimations were made based only on individual history, behavior, operating conditions and failure thresholds. Both analytic and bootstrapping techniques were used in the estimation process. Finally, by including recursive parameter estimation and a forgetting factor, the ARX methodology adapts to changing operating conditions and maintain the focus on the current degradation level of an asset.}

  abstract = {In this study, an online monitoring technique for continuous fatigue crack quantification and remaining fatigue life estimation is developed for plate-like structures using nonlinear ultrasonic modulation and an artificial neural network (ANN). First, multiple aluminum plates of different thicknesses are subjected to cyclic loading tests at a constant amplitude, and the ultrasonic responses are obtained from the piezoelectric transducers attached to each specimen. Second, an ANN is constructed by defining (1) the specimen thickness; the elapsed fatigue cycles; and two features extracted from the ultrasonic responses, namely, the cumulative increase and decrease in the nonlinear beta parameter, as inputs and (2) the crack length and remaining fatigue life as outputs. Then, the architecture and learning parameter of the ANN are optimized using the data obtained from the specimen tests. Finally, the performance of the trained ANN is examined using the blind test data obtained from additional specimens. The results of the blind tests indicate that the proposed technique can estimate the crack length and remaining fatigue life with a maximum error of 2 mm and 3 k cycles, respectively, for the tested aluminum plates. The uniqueness of this technique lies in (1) the fatigue crack quantification and remaining fatigue life estimation using nonlinear ultrasonic modulation and (2) the data-driven crack quantification and prognosis using an ANN for online monitoring.}

However, crack evolution in aerospace structure is a complicated process affected by many condition factors, such as the temperature, mission load, structural boundary condition and material characteristic. These factors are coupled with each other and cause serious uncertainties to the crack evolution in the structure. Ordinary methods by mapping or calibration using a set of same structural specimens or simulation to achieve an average mapping result cannot provide accurate results to a specific structure monitored, since this structure inevitably has deviations from the average result. Aiming at solving this problem, an on-line updated guided wave Gaussian Process based evaluation method is proposed in this paper, which differs from the current Gaussian Process research in the way of model dynamic updating. The proposed method is verified on attachment lug structures, which is a kind of important connection part commonly used in aircrafts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is well demonstrated.},

However, one of the key challenges of practical engineering applications is the accurate interpretation of the guided wave signals under time-varying environmental and operational conditions. This paper presents a guided wave-hidden Markov model based method to improve the damage evaluation reliability of real aircraft structures under time-varying conditions. In the proposed approach, an HMM based unweighted moving average trend estimation method, which can capture the trend of damage propagation from the posterior probability obtained by HMM modeling is used to achieve a probabilistic evaluation of the structural damage. To validate the developed method, experiments are performed on a hole-edge crack specimen under fatigue loading condition and a real aircraft wing spar under changing structural boundary conditions. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method.}

To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in “new” or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology.}

Many parameters influence the printing process; however, defects resulting from suboptimal parameter settings are usually detected after the process. To detect these defects during the printing, different process monitoring techniques such as melt pool monitoring or off-axis infrared monitoring have been proposed. In this work, we used a combination of thermographic off-axis imaging as data source and deep learning-based neural network architectures, to detect printing defects. For the network training, a k-fold cross validation and a hold-out cross validation were used. With these techniques, defects such as delamination and splatter can be recognized with an accuracy of 96.80{\%}. In addition, the model was evaluated with computing class activation heatmaps. The architecture is very small and has low computing costs, which means that it is suitable to operate in real time even on less powerful hardware.},

The acoustic emission data pre-processing to extract damage sensitive health indicators and the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters from the training set are discussed in detail. In parallel, a Bayesian version of a well-established machine learning technique i.e. neural networks, is utilized to approach the remaining useful life estimation as a non-linear regression task. A comparison between the two algorithms training, operation, input-output and performance, highlights their ability to offer reliable remaining useful life estimates conditional on health monitoring data from composite structures under service loading. Both approaches result in very good estimations of the mean remaining useful life of unseen data. NHHSMM is concluded as the preferable option as it provides much less volatile predictions and more importantly is characterized by confidence intervals which shorten as more data come into play, an essential trait of a robust prognostic algorithm.}
