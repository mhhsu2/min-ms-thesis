  abstract  = {Metallic materials are extensively used in engineering structures and fatigue failure is one of the most common failure modes of metal structures. Fatigue phenomena occur when a material is subjected to fluctuating stresses and strains, which lead to failure due to damage accumulation. Different methods, including the Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule- (LDR-) based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, energy-based, and continuum damage mechanics methods, forecast fatigue life. This paper reviews fatigue life prediction techniques for metallic materials. An ideal fatigue life prediction model should include the main features of those already established methods, and its implementation in simulation systems could help engineers and scientists in different applications. In conclusion, LDR-based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, continuum damage mechanics, and energy-based methods are easy, realistic, microstructure dependent, well timed, and damage connected, respectively, for the ideal prediction model.},

  abstract = {Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation (QNDE) provides techniques to assess deterioration of a material or a structure, and to detect and characterize discrete flaws. It plays, therefore, an important role in the prevention of failure. QNDE techniques are used in processing, manufacturing and for in-service inspection. QNDE is particularly important for the in-service inspection of high-cost and critical load-bearing structures whose failure could have tragic consequences. In this paper, we briefly review the most important techniques, and then we focus the discussion on quantitative ultrasonics, particularly for crack detection and for the determination of elastic constants. The important role of measurement models is emphasized. New techniques in quantitative ultrasonics are discussed, including laser-based ultrasonics and acoustic microscopy. The possible applications of neural networks are indicated. Attention is also devoted to the probability of detection concept and its relation to probabilistic fatigue methods and fatigue reliability.}

  abstract = {A new method, based on the infrared thermography, was proposed and applied to rapidly determine the fatigue behavior of Q235 steel. The temperature evolution due to localized microplasticity was considered as the fatigue damage indicator, and good predictions were confirmed between the predicted values and the traditional values. The temperature patterns of the hot-spot zone on the specimen surface were tightly linked with the physical evolution of the fatigue damage in order to identify the damage status for safety evaluation. Based on the limiting energy theory, an energetic damage model was established to predict the residual fatigue life.}
