  abstract  = {Metallic materials are extensively used in engineering structures and fatigue failure is one of the most common failure modes of metal structures. Fatigue phenomena occur when a material is subjected to fluctuating stresses and strains, which lead to failure due to damage accumulation. Different methods, including the Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule- (LDR-) based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, energy-based, and continuum damage mechanics methods, forecast fatigue life. This paper reviews fatigue life prediction techniques for metallic materials. An ideal fatigue life prediction model should include the main features of those already established methods, and its implementation in simulation systems could help engineers and scientists in different applications. In conclusion, LDR-based, multiaxial and variable amplitude loading, stochastic-based, continuum damage mechanics, and energy-based methods are easy, realistic, microstructure dependent, well timed, and damage connected, respectively, for the ideal prediction model.},

It plays, therefore, an important role in the prevention of failure. QNDE techniques are used in processing, manufacturing and for in-service inspection. QNDE is particularly important for the in-service inspection of high-cost and critical load-bearing structures whose failure could have tragic consequences. In this paper, we briefly review the most important techniques, and then we focus the discussion on quantitative ultrasonics, particularly for crack detection and for the determination of elastic constants. The important role of measurement models is emphasized. New techniques in quantitative ultrasonics are discussed, including laser-based ultrasonics and acoustic microscopy. The possible applications of neural networks are indicated. Attention is also devoted to the probability of detection concept and its relation to probabilistic fatigue methods and fatigue reliability.}

  abstract = {Results are reported of recent experiments which used change in ultrasonic attenuation measurements as a continuous monitor of fatigue damage during cyclic testing of polycrystalline aluminum and steel specimens. Ultrasonic pulses were generated by an x-cut quartz transducer firmly attached to the clamped end of a specimen rod using Eastman 910 cement. The frequencies of these ultrasonic pulses were 10 MHz for polycrystalline aluminum and 5 MHz for cold rolled steel. The specimen shape, transducer size, and frequency used insured that the entire specimen was completely filled with ultrasound in a guided wave mode. The specimen was fatigued as a cantilever beam in reverse bending at 1800 cycles per minute with vertical amplitude peak-to-peak set at a fixed value in the range 7·5–15 mm. In a typical test the ultrasonic attenuation initially remained constant, increased slowly, and then increased catastropically just prior to fracture of the test specimen. All experiments performed on both aluminum and steel specimens at various vibrational amplitudes yielded similar results in that ultrasonic attenuation served as a very sensitive indicator of fatigue damage and in every case indicated that failure was eminent several hours before conventional ultrasonic testing could detect an additional echo caused by energy reflected from a crack. These results strongly suggest that ultrasonic attenuation measurements can be exploited successfully to predict earlier fatigue damage and perhaps fatigue life in practical applications.}

Wavelet transform is used to derive a feature vector which contains two-dimensional information on various types of defects. These vectors are then classified using an ANN trained with the back propagation algorithm. The inputs of the ANN are the features extracted from each ultrasonic oscillogram. Four different types of defect are considered namely porosity, lack of fusion, and tungsten inclusion and non defect. The training of the ANN uses supervised learning mechanism and therefore each input has the respective desired output. The available dataset is randomly split into a training subset (to update the weight values) and a validation subset. With the wavelet features and ANN, good classification at the rate of 94{\%} is obtained. According to the results, the algorithms developed and applied to ultrasonic signals are highly reliable and precise for online quality monitoring.},

New universal relations are deduced. An approach to evaluation of stress which does not use calibration specimens and makes full use of universal relations in our acoustoelastic theory is advocated.

This technique is based on the acoustoelastic effect in which the presence of the residual stress causes a shift in the speed at which a wave propagates through the material. The particular acoustoelastic technique considered here employs longitudinal waves propagating normal to the plane of the stress. Such waves experience a shift in propagation speed which, for an isotropic material, is proportional to the sum of the principal stresses. A Poisson’s equation for the in-plane shear stress is obtained from the two-dimensional equilibrium equations in which the forcing function is obtained directly from the measured velocity variations. Once this equation is integrated for the shear stress, the normal stresses may be evaluated directly from the equilibrium equations. In this paper, the basic equations are derived for the case of an anisotropic material. The experimental and numerical procedures are reviewed, and results of residual stresses in an aluminum ring are presented.}},

  abstract = {The planned life extension of nuclear reactors throughout the US and abroad will cause reactor vessel and internals materials to be exposed to more neutron irradiation than was originally intended. A nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method to monitor radiation damage would enable safe and cost-effective continued operation of nuclear reactors. Radiation damage in reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels causes microstructural changes that leave the material in an embrittled state. Nonlinear ultrasound is an NDE technique quantified by the measurable acoustic nonlinearity parameter, which is sensitive to microstructural changes in metallic materials such as dislocations, precipitates and their combinations. Recent research has demonstrated the sensitivity of the acoustic nonlinearity parameter to increasing neutron fluence in representative RPV steels. The current work considers nonlinear ultrasonic experiments conducted on similar RPV steel samples that had a combination of irradiation, annealing, re-irradiation, and/or re-annealing to a total neutron fluence of 0.5–5×1019n/cm2 (E>1MeV) at an irradiation temperature of 290°C. The acoustic nonlinearity parameter generally increased with increasing neutron fluence, and consistently decreased from the irradiated to the annealed state over different levels of neutron fluence. Results of the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter are compared with those from previous measurements on other RPV steel samples. This comprehensive set of results illustrates the dependence of the measured acoustic nonlinearity parameter on neutron fluence, material composition, irradiation temperature and annealing.}

  abstract = {The ultimate strength of most structural materials is mainly limited by the presence of microscopic imperfections serving as nuclei of the fracture process. Since these nuclei are considerably shorter than the acoustic wavelength at the frequencies normally used in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE), linear acoustic characteristics are not sufficiently sensitive to this kind of microscopic degradation of the material's integrity. On the other hand, even very small imperfections can produce very significant excess nonlinearity which can be orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic nonlinearity of the intact material. The excess nonlinearity is produced mainly by the strong local nonlinearity of microcracks whose opening is smaller than the particle displacement. Parametric modulation via crack-closure significantly increases the stress-dependence of fatigued materials. A special experimental technique was introduced to measure the second-order acousto-elastic coefficient in a great variety of materials including plastics, metals, composites and adhesives. Experimental results are presented to illustrate that the nonlinear acoustic parameters are earlier and more sensitive indicators of fatigue damage than their linear counterparts.}
